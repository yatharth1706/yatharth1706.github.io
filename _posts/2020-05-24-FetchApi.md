Fetch Api is used to make network requests to the server.

For example, we can use a network request to:

* Submit an order,
* Load user information,
* Receive latest updates from the server,
* …etc.

**Basic Syntax of Fetch**

```js
let promise = fetch(url, [options])
```

Fetch method has two parameters:
1. ***url***: Server's address to whom you want to make network requests.
2. ***options***: These are optional parameters where you can pass headers, methods (Example: GET, POST) etc...

**Note:** Without options fetch api will be of type GET Method which will only download the contents from server in the form of json or text.

When a fetch method is called then first it will return a promise which resolves into a object of built in ```Response``` Class as soon as server responds with headers.

**Example:**
```js
let response = await fetch(url);

if (response.ok) { // if HTTP-status is 200-299
  // get the response body (the method explained below)
  let json = await response.json();
} else {
  alert("HTTP-Error: " + response.status);
}
```

Second, to get the response body, we need to use an additional method call.

Response provides multiple promise-based methods to access the body in various formats:

* **response.text()** – read the response and return as text,
* **response.json()** – parse the response as JSON,
* **response.formData()** – return the response as FormData object (explained in the next chapter),
* **response.blob()** – return the response as Blob (binary data with type),
* **response.arrayBuffer()** – return the response as ArrayBuffer (low-level representaion of * binary data),
* additionally, response.body is a ReadableStream object, it allows you to read the body chunk-by-chunk, we’ll see an example later.
